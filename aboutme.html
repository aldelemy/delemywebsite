    <h1>About me:</h1>
           
    <p class="backroundcolor size color">  My name is Ahmed Aldelemy, I am from Iraq, I have been living in Manchester with my fami-ly since November 2019, I arrived in the UK in June 2018 as an asylum seeker and then I was granted asylum in March 2019, I am married and have three children.
        My Education:
        I graduated from the Iraqi Air Force College in 1993 with a Licence of Aviation and worked as a pilot in the Iraqi Army for three years. Then I started studying computer science and grad-uated in 2000. I am currently in the final phase of my master's study, expecting to graduate with merit in two months. I think it’s honourable to mention that I am a man who loves re-search and finds gratification in reading.</p>
